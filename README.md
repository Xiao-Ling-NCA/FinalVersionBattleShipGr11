I didnt need to have multiple files according to the rubric but back then I refused to actually have 1000 lines in an unorganized fashion. I also hate reading so having 1000 lines in one file just makes me want to push my .env into production üëç.

And so I did what I knew best: put all the different static methods into different files and called it a day. Only a year later did I realize that I basically did pea-brain Object Oriented Programming - which is OOP but its actually just Object Programming with lots and lots of bugs.

To run the game, run "GameRunTime.java".

Dont worry about the other files. 0/10 definitely would not recommend looking at the backend of this code
